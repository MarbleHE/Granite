/// The namespace Granite and class G provide a simple interface for the evaluation and analysis of a FHE function
/// A user can provide a function, written with the type G. This has the effect, that using the overloaded operators,
/// the instances can pass an AST, as the function is being executed.
/// This then results in a bottom-up construction of the unrolled AST of the function, which can be used by the library Wool for further use.
/// An example can be found in the examples folder, e.g. the hd_enc example.
///
/// The namespace mainly consists of convenience functions, which exist to provide a functional interface for G.
/// The class implements the public interface of overloaded operators.
/// It also contains the methods serving as a wrapper for the Wool methods, which are responsible for actual execution and benchmarking of the code.
